Git and GitHub Hands-on Practice
This guide will walk you through the steps of the provided assignment, helping you gain practical experience with Git, GitHub, and open-source contribution.

Task 1: Cloning and Forking

Choosing a Public GitHub Repository:
Browse GitHub (https://github.com/) and search for public repositories related to your field of study.
Look for projects with clear documentation and an active community (indicated by stars and forks).
Cloning the Repository:
Once you've chosen a repository, click the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS clone URL.
Open a terminal window on your computer.
Use the git clone command followed by the URL you copied to clone the repository locally.
Bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository_name>.git
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Replace <username> with the repository owner's username and <repository_name> with the actual name of the repository.
Exploring the Repository:
Navigate to the cloned directory using the cd command in your terminal.
Use commands like ls to view the repository's file structure, cat to view file contents, and git log to explore the commit history.
Task 2: Managing Branches

Creating a New Branch:
Use the git branch <branch_name> command to create a new branch.
Bash
git branch feature-update
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Replace <branch_name> with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., "feature-update").
Switching Branches:
Use the git checkout <branch_name> command to switch to the newly created branch.
Bash
git checkout feature-update
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Task 3: Making Changes and Committing

Modifying Files:
Use your preferred text editor to make changes to an existing file or create a new file in the repository.
Committing Changes:
Stage your changes for commit using the git add <filename> command (or git add . to add all modified files).
Enter a commit message summarizing your changes and run git commit -m "<your_message>" to save the changes to the branch.
Task 4: Merging Changes

Switching Back to Main Branch:
Use git checkout main to switch back to the main branch of the repository.
Merging the Feature Branch:
Use git merge feature-update to merge the changes from your feature branch (feature-update) into the main branch.
If there are no conflicts (changes to the same lines of code), the merge will happen seamlessly.
If conflicts arise, you'll need to resolve them manually before completing the merge (covered in Task 7).
Task 5: Handling Conflicts

** (This task requires prior modification in your forked repository)**

Creating Conflicts (on forked repository):
Make changes to the same file you modified in Task 4 on your forked repository, not your local clone.
Commit these changes in your forked repository.
Resolving Conflicts (on local clone):
Switch back to your local clone and create a new branch to resolve the conflict (e.g., resolve-conflict).
Bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b resolve-conflict
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Git will mark the conflicted sections of the file with special characters (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
Manually edit the file to resolve the conflicts, choosing the desired changes from each branch.
Once resolved, stage and commit the changes in the resolve-conflict branch.
Merging the Conflict Resolution Branch:
Use git checkout main to switch back to the main branch.
Merge the resolve-conflict branch into the main branch using git merge resolve-conflict.
This should now merge without further conflicts.
Task 6: GitHub Pages

Enabling GitHub Pages (on forked repository):
Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
Go to Settings > Pages.
Choose a source (select the branch to publish - typically main).
Click "Save" to enable GitHub Pages.
Accessing the Published Page:
GitHub Pages will create a URL for your repository's website (usually in the format <username>.github.io/<repository_name>).
Visit this URL in your web browser to see your index.html file displayed online.
Task 7: Open Source Exploration
   Head over to GitHub (https://github.com/).
Use the search bar to find projects related to your field of interest. You can also browse by category or trending repositories.
Here are some tips for choosing a project:

* Look for projects with clear documentation and an active community (indicated by stars and forks).
* Consider your skillset and choose a project where you can potentially contribute something meaningful.
* Start with smaller projects if you're new to open-source exploration.
  
2. Delving into the Project:

Once you've chosen a project, explore its README file. This file typically provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage examples.
Check the project's documentation for detailed information about its features, API, and usage guides.
Look at the project's issues section. This will give you insights into current challenges, bugs, and feature requests.
Review the contribution guidelines. This document outlines the process for submitting code changes, reporting issues, and contributing to the project.
3. Contributing to the Project:

If you find a bug or have an improvement suggestion, you can open a new issue. Clearly describe the issue you're facing or the improvement you propose.
If you have the coding skills, you can even consider fixing a bug or implementing a feature yourself. Follow the contribution guidelines for submitting a pull request with your changes.
